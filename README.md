Ok so, this is the simplest poll ever made using 4 different mandatory aws services.\

Q: What does this poll do? \
A: Well, you can insert a question and all the options for that question.\
Q: What can you do with it?\
A: You can send the link of your poll to your group, via any communcation platform and open it in the browser on any device. This way you can finally decide whose car to take to the drive through (and this time Daniel has a say in it, even though we will all vote for Daniel's).\

On a serious note, it's a poll application and when you send the link to a person, it can't vote twice because of the device's fingerprint.\
